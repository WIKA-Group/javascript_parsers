#### Description of the device

The model PGU2x.100 pressure gauge in combination with the model NETRIS®3 radio unit is used wherever web-based remote monitoring of the process pressure is desired in addition to on-site indication.
The model PGU2x.100 combines a mechanical measuring system with electronic signal processing and is intended for connection to the WIKA model NETRIS®3 radio unit. In this way, cloud based process and plant monitoring can be realised in industrial applications. Condition-based and preventive maintenance through centralised big data analysis is thus possible.
The model PGU2x.100 pressure gauge fulfils safety-rrequirements of the relevant standards and regulations for the on-site indication of the operating pressure of pressure vessels.
The model PGU2x is based upon a model 2xx.30 high-quality, safety pressure gauge with a nominal size of 100, which corresponds to the S3 safety version of the EN 837-1.
The WIKA measuring instrument PGU2x.100 is part of the 
WIKA IIoT solution. With this, WIKA offers a holistic solution 
for your digitalisation strategy.
