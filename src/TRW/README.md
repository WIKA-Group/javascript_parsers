#### Description of the device

The model TRW is a radio-based resistance thermometer for monitoring medium temperatures of all types. Resistance thermometers in this series can be installed directly into the process or combined with a large number of thermowell designs. It uses the licence-free LoRaWAN® and Bluetooth® radio standards and is used, for example, on mobile equipment and remote measuring points. Thanks to intelligent measurement and transmission control and a replaceable 
battery, the sensor can be operated for years without maintenance.
