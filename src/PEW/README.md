#### Description of the device

The model PEW-1x00 is a radio-based pressure sensor for monitoring liquids and gases. It uses the licence-free LoRaWAN® and Bluetooth® radio standards and is used, for example, on mobile equipment and remote measuring points. Thanks to intelligent measurement and transmission control and a replaceable battery, the sensor can be operated for years without maintenance.
The intelligent configuration allows measurement and transmission intervals that are dependent on the measured value. In addition, the sensor can measure continuously without transmitting every measured value. This means: high safety with low data and energy consumption. All data is available digitally in a cost-efficient way and allows automated analyses.
Thanks to numerous process connections and the two available standards − LoRaWAN® for the kilometre range and Bluetooth® for the metre range − the pressure sensor can be flexibly configured.
Via retrofit, machinery or moving parts can be configured smartly − without having to plan and document cable routing. Particularly when no continuous measurement is needed, cost advantages can be realised.
The model PEW-1x00 is built to be robust and shockresistant. Thanks to IP65, it is well protected against dust and splash water. The battery is preassembled and can be replaced easily. It is not necessary to replace the entire pressure sensor.
The sensor enables simple condition monitoring. A temperature indication, in addition to the pressure value, reveals possible malfunctions due to wear or system faults at an early stage and thus reduces the risk of downtime and damage.
