#### Description of the device

The model TRU miniature resistance thermometer in combination with the model NETRIS®3 radio unit is used wherever web-based remote monitoring of the process pressure is desired. Condition-based and preventive maintenance through centralised big data analysis is thus possible.
Resistance thermometers in this series can be installed directly into the process or combined with a large number of thermowell designs. Surface temperature measurements, e.g. on a tubeskin, can be performed using a tightening strap.The instruments are intrinsically safe and suitable for use in hazardous areas. 
All electrical components are protected against powerful water jet (IP66) and the effects of temporary immersion in water (IP67) and designed to withstand vibration (10 g amplitude / 20 g peak-to-peak, depending on instrument version).
The resistance thermometer has an integrated transmitter that sends and receives data via a digital interface. The electrical connection is made via an M12 x 1 circular connector.
The resistance thermometer model TRU is part of the WIKA IIoT solution. With this, WIKA offers a holistic solution for your digitalisation strategy
