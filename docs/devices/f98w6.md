#### Description of the device

Strain transducers have been designed for applications in which there is a need to measure the deformation due to external forces acting on existing components. The transducer is simply screwed to the component. After the adjustment, the unit has the features of a force transducer.
The strain transducer is fastened with four screws to an area of the structure where the relevant strain occurs. Combined strain transducers can be connected directly to a junction box that contains an amplifier for system control.
