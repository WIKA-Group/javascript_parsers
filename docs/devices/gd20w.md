# GD20W Gas Density Transmitter

![GD20W](/GD20W.png)

#### Description of the device

In order to prevent system failures in switchgear and network outages, the permanent monitoring of the gas density is essential.

The model GD-20-W calculates the current gas density from the pressure and temperature using a complex virial equation in the gas density sensorâ€™s powerful microprocessor. Pressure changes resulting from temperature effects will be compensated by this and will not affect the output value.

## JavaScript Parser API

The following functions are exposed by the JavaScript parser:

- `decodeUplink(input)`
- `decodeHexString(fPort, hexEncodedString)`
- `decodeBase64String(fPort, base64EncodedString)`

See the [API Description](/users/api-description) for full details on how to use these functions.
