# Supported Devices

> **Disclaimer:** “TULIP” is WIKA’s internal application-layer protocol used to encode and decode device data across wireless transports such as LoRa® and LoRaWAN®. It is a protocol codename, not a product name, and is referenced here solely for documentation clarity.

WIKA LPWAN devices are supported to varying degrees depending on three factors:

- Parser generation (TULIP2 vs TULIP3)
- Device capabilities and supported features
- Device firmware

This page summarizes the current regional availability of parser generations, a device-level support matrix and which parsers are included in the NPM module [`@w2a-iiot/parsers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@w2a-iiot/parsers).

## Regional availability

| Region | TULIP2 | TULIP3 |
|--------|:------:|:------:|
| Europe | ✔️ (current) | ❌ |
| India  | ✔️ (current) | ❌ |
| North America | ❌ | ✔️ (current) |
| Other regions | ❌ | ❌ |

Note: region availability may change in the future, additional regions such as South America, Africa, or Oceania may be added later.

**Legend:**
- <span title="Implemented">✔️</span> implemented in the parser (and supported by device)
- <span title="Not implemented">❌</span> supported by device, but not yet implemented in the parser
- <span title="Not supported by device">⚪</span> not supported by the device (regardless of parser)

> Note: TULIP2 was reimplemented multiple times, expect some differences in behavior between the various TULIP2 parsers.

## NPM Module Inclusion

Some parsers are available as part of the NPM module [`@w2a-iiot/parsers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@w2a-iiot/parsers).
